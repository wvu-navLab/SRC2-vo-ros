# VO
Pipelines for Visual Odometry in C++

## Requirements
This code requires C++11 and OpenCV 3.2.0 or greater. To install OpenCV, an [install script](https://github.com/wvu-irl/wvu_vo/blob/master/scripts/install_opencv.sh) is provided in the scripts folder. NOTE: If using this library with the [ROS wrapper](https://github.com/wvu-irl/wvu_vo_ros), OpenCV likely does not need to be installed separately.
